**Updating your status**

If you’re going on holiday then we *certainly* don’t want to disturb you! Once it’s been approved we’ll be alerted on Slack throughout the duration of your leave. Slack lets you change your status so before you leave on holiday you can update that as well if you remember. This will stop us accidentally tagging you when you’re hiking in the Alps, exploring Machu Picchu or relaxing on the beach in Bali.

Nomads travel a lot - that’s one of the benefits of working remotely. You may have to go through pockets that will affect your connectivity or go offline completely. A post on [#whereabouts] (https://esanjo.slack.com/messages/C6B78S1NK/) will let us know what to expect.

Once you’ve arrived at your destination let us know where you’re signing in from on #whereabouts. No, we’re not stalking you - we’re just curious as cats! Check our [core values] (https://way.esanjo.com/about/core-values/) if you don’t believe me.

If you’re taking a long trip and think you may only be online sporadically if at all, it makes sense to just apply for leave for that day. At Esanjo we have [unlimited leave] (https://way.esanjo.com/people-ops/how-we-do-leave/) so nobody’s counting anyway.

You may be on holiday in an area where fellow Esanjo nomads work. If you’d like to visit we’d love to see you! Just give us a heads up on #general on what time you’ll be dropping by if we have an office or work space in the area. If not just tag the nomads in your area and arrange to meet somewhere convenient. Don’t forget we all love treats so don’t forget to bring us a little something!

**Using #whereabouts**

Don’t forget that the purpose of the [#whereabouts] (https://esanjo.slack.com/messages/C6B78S1NK/) channel is to let us know who is available and who isn’t. It is not for discussions - we have plenty of other channels for that. If you want to comment on someone’s #whereabouts post, please move it to #random.

It is for the same reason that we don’t want people opening threads on #whereabouts. A thread used as an update means people looking for you need to waste time opening the thread. Just post your update directly in the channel where we can all see it.

Just to keep things fun though, you are allowed to react to a post with an emoji!
