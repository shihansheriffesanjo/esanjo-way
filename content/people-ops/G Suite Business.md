We use Google's G Suite for email and to collaborate on documents via Google Drive. We’ve just upgraded to *G Suite Business*, this brings a bunch of new features, a few of which I’ve highlighted below:

## 1. [Google Cloud Search](https://cloudsearch.google.com/.)

This basically brings the power of Google Search to all of the content that we have across Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides and Calendar. It’s absolutely awesome and supports natural language queries such “docs owned by naila” = all the org wide documents that are owned by @naila, or “emails with jadopado mall from 2017" = all the emails that include the keyword “jadopado mall” from 1st January 2017 through to 31st December 2017. This is really worth checking out and keeping bookmarked for future use!

## 2. Unlimited Storage

Not that most of us need it, but we’ve now all got unlimited storage across Gmail, Drive and everything else = feel free to keep everything if you want to :wink:


## 3. Team Drives

This is a big one and the primary reason why we upgraded. At the moment, when you use Google Drive, a document that you create is owned by you and is something that you can share with others. This works well in most cases, but doesn’t work well when you’ve got multiple owners of various bits and pieces for a given project. For example, @karlo could own the specification document for Project X, whilst I may own the content for a given area. I may end up un-sharing and deleting my document in error, or organising it in a super haphazard manner (!) that makes it difficult for anyone else to understand. Team Drives fixes this by building on the notion of a file in a Team Drive belonging to the team instead of to an individual. Over the next few weeks we’ll migrate our projects and other bits such as Finance to use Team Drives instead of individual Drives. This should help us collectively organise and manage better.

Lastly, here’s a list of additional features if you’re curious about what else may be available on the [new plan](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6034782?hl=en)

## 4. Google Groups

 We set up a couple of new Google Groups (engineering@esanjo.com and localisation@esanjo.com) and have sent invites to the Engineering and  Localisation teams to our Team Drive for Lochal. Previously tested with the Product team (product@esanjo.com) and figured we'd try using groups rather than sending out individual invites. It should in theory result in adding someone to a group should automatically give them access to all team drives shared with that group.

Let’s see how this goes or will switch back to standard individual invites. We also have a group for everyone in the organisation (everyone@esanjo.com) so that we can share certain Team Drives with everyone.
