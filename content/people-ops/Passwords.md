This is part of an extract that was posted on Slack in regards to using strong passwords on the [3rd of September 2018](https://esanjo.slack.com/archives/C63E39KK7/p1535960038000100). 

In all seriousness, whilst password length isn’t the best indicator of security, setting a unique randomly generated password using a password manager like *1Password* (our platform of choice!) is a super solid way to keep yourself and the entire organisation secure.

Whilst it can be painful at times when you’re not able to just type in your password, changing your authentication flow to use a password manager and its browser extensions is totally worth it the day you find a previously trusted service has had its DB compromised and the one password that you used all over the internet results in either mass panic change out of passwords or your identity is compromised and someone somewhere is happily shopping over at ~noon~ Amazon with your stolen credit card /security-rant
