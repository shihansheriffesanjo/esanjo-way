## One Golden Rule
We have one golden rule about spending at Esanjo, please treat company money as if it were your own. You can claim anything back that is a company related expense (i.e: travel, meetings, calls and so on - please keep a receipt for everything!). Anything above a USD 50 limit will need pre-approval from the Finance team.

## How do I make a claim?
We've tried to make this easy and keep it simple to get it up and running.

For all expense claims, we've got a parent folder set up on Google Drive that the Finance team have access to called: [Expense Claims 2018/19](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x7lvfYuA6i3KVq4RqHn0CvlMje--Js4a?usp=sharing). Each person will have their own sub folder within, designated by their name. It is important that you keep this folder organised.

Every month, please create a new folder using the naming convention "Month Year", for example “January 2018” and upload any bills together with any related documents for an expense that you'd like to claim.

Please upload any claims by the 24th of every month ping the @financeall team in the [#finance](https://esanjo.slack.com/messages/C661QBKM3) Slack channel with a quick heads up. Any claims uploaded after the 24th will be settled in the following month.

## Requesting pre-approvals
If you need pre-approval for an expense please upload your quotes to this folder, [Pre-Approvals](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-HHsuETumhJ51veSK7BOhnMbN_ZMyito) and add the details to the Google sheet called [Pre-Approval Requests](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OSM4UOx3rAJTCbgGOFhtpAmTGKUSqVIYESLRqU9WE5M/edit#gid=0) that you’ll find within. Please number your quotes so that they correspond to the  sheet and ping the @financeall team in the [#finance](https://esanjo.slack.com/messages/C661QBKM3) Slack channel with a heads up.

As with most things we'll experiment with these processes and will iterate them as we go along.
