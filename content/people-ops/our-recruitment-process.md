#Our Recruitment Process

##The phone screen 

This is our first contact with the candidate. The questions are simple but we look at more than just the answers themselves. The way in which the candidates answer is just as important. Are the answers consistent? Have they made an effort to prepare for a possible phone screen?, Did they do any in-depth checks on the job role and the company?, What questions do they ask? How enthusiastic are they? Do they have the correct attitude?

The ability to communicate is incredibly important. We work as a team and so need to be able to communicate clearly with each other especially in a remote environment. If a candidate has trouble understanding the questions, answers a different question than asked, or does not have sufficient vocabulary to answer we already have a problem. The ability to communicate clearly - understand and be understood - is essential. Drop anyone who can’t right now regardless of the rest of their qualifications.


Let the candidate know why you’re calling and how long the phone screen will take. Be flexible - it may not be a good time for them so if they’re not immediately available schedule a better time that works for both of you. Be prepared to go the extra mile because some candidates are only available outside of normal working hours or may be in a completely different time zone than you. 


###The questions

The basic questions are what, why, when, how much, and do you have any questions for us? 

What

We ask the candidate to give us a brief history of their career and what kind of work they’ve been doing so far. This allows us to assess communication skills, consistency of information (compared to their CVs and other comments they make), confidence, and their own knowledge of their skills and the jobs they’ve been doing so far. 

Look out for what they focus on and how. A candidate who mumbles through their CV is not a strong candidate. A candidate who ties their experience and skill into our job’s requirements is. 

Use this opportunity to clarify information from the candidates’ CVs. For example, find out why they’ve never stayed longer than four months at a job, or if they can provide two work related referees if they haven’t done that already. Check whether they are following any courses. These might affect their proposed work schedules or availability on the one hand and on the other be beneficial to the company in the long run.

Take notes. Sometimes candidates will mention interesting things that aren’t in their CVs but have relevance to the job we’re recruiting for or to the work we do in general. Don’t be afraid to pursue something interesting but be sure to keep it short. There will be enough time to go into details if they reach the interview stage.

Why

Find out why the candidate applied for this particular job. If they are making a major career change, find out what led them to this decision. Ask why they chose Esanjo. Make a note of how well they’ve researched the company; whether they’ve just glanced at the website or actually taken the time to read The Esanjo Way. Referrals will know more about our internal culture from the team member who referred them but don’t forget to make sure that they’ve done their background checks as well and are not just relying on what they’ve heard. We want to hire people who are really interested in our company and who are excited about how we do things. 

Find out why they are leaving their present job. It will help us understand what motivates them.

When

We need to know when the candidates can start work. Are they available immediately? Do they have a notice period in their current role? The notice period tends to be one month but this can differ from company to company. A longer notice period may affect a candidates application especially if we need to fill the position as soon as possible. On the other hand incredible people are not easy to find. Don't let the length of the notice period deter your judgment.

This information lets us fix a start date in the event that the candidate is offered the position.

How much

This is a very important question. We need a clear idea of a candidate’s expectations. If a candidate cannot give us a solid figure or persists in being vague then this where their application stops.

Even candidates with absolutely no work experience should have some idea of how much the job pays when they apply. If nothing else they should at least know how much they need to survive.

We do not reveal our remuneration scales or budgets to candidates. The purpose of this question is not to negotiate but to find out exactly how much the candidate really wants. It also lets us know how the candidates value themselves given their skills, training and experience. 

Remote working experience

Does the candidate have any experience working remotely? If they do, ask them to share their experience. How did they adapt to the challenges? If they don’t have experience ask them how they plan to adapt to working from home. Remote job roles are increasing but some people don’t realise that this literally means that they won’t be reporting in to an office. Remember there is no ‘right’ answer to this question. This question clarifies remote working to the candidate and their answers give us an idea of how they will adapt if they’ve not done it before.

Extras

Some of our positions need a few job specific questions. This is where you add those. Examples include, ‘what tech do you use?’ for engineering candidates, ‘what accounting packages have you used?’ for finance and accounting candidates and, for job roles that will cover 24/7 ‘do you have a problem working outside of normal office hours/ weekends/ holidays’. 

Questions

Don’t forget to ask the candidate if they have any questions for us. Make a note of what they ask and how you answered. If they don’t ask any questions, make a note of that too! Be sure to answer all questions clearly. 

Candidates may ask you technical questions that need in-depth answers from an expert. Make a note of these and let the candidate know that if they progress to the next stage they’ll be able to get more detailed information.

Tips

Smile. They can’t see you but they can hear it in your voice. Always be polite. 

A phone screen takes 10-15 minutes tops. It shouldn’t run longer than that. A very short phone screen may be a sign that this is the wrong candidate.
